# Sorting-Algo-Visualizer
A simple approach to visualize a few well known sorting algorithms with a random data set everytime you use the tool.

This tool clearly visualizes and dictates the importance of different types of sorting algortihms and can clearly give you an idea of which algortihm to use in different situations.

\n\n Currently a WIP. Future scope includes visualizing Quick sort and Merge sort as well.
